Description: A nearest neighbor (variance-) algorithm to find similar areas in images. The algorithms search for identcal areas in all possible shifts of one image to itself or between different images. The comparisons are pixelwise, in a nearest neighbor block (a pixel and its eight direct neighbors) or in the variances of the nearest neighbour differences.
